    <h2 class="paraheader">so, about the new web...</h2>
    <p>
      i've seen all of those internet manifestos about how people want the old web back, and i want to present my own take on it.<br>
      
      i *love* sites with passion put into them. i mean, i've always put so much heart-bursting passion into my own personal projects.
      <br>but i dont think what most 'take back the web' people realize is, well, taking back the web isnt that easy.
      <br>search engines are made for popular sites and algorithims. passionate sites, oozing the fact they were made <br>by a *human* for a *human*, wont show up that easily.
      <br>even then, do you think all of the people outside want to 'take back the web'?
      <br>what this results in is small communities that kinda just talk about taking back the web while nothing really happens.
      <br>
      <br>
      what these people also dont realize is that, well...i *love* graphic design, so i may be biased, but:
      <br>you cant stick with web 1.0 sites all of the time.
      <br>i get it for passionate, human made sites! but for actual, professional taking back the web sites, its always barebones css that<br> looks nice but feels lazy.
      <br>you also cant stick with web 1.0 for the simple fact that not everyone is old enough to get a feeling of nostalgia from web 1.0. <br>some people dont even remember what web 2.0 was like!
      <br>and that includes me. i think web 1.0 looks, frankly, unprofessional for the movement.
      <br>
      <br>
      while i dont want to see people harassed into changing their website layout or something, i dont just want a real, human made web.<br>
      i want both that and a visually appealing web. a web where you can see peoples passions layed out in a smooth, <br>flowing matter, full of colours and expressions they like, yet with a soft feel where you can tell it isnt trying to be all corporate.
      </p>

      <p class="tdlr">td:lr:<br>
        i want the old web back. i want to *experience* the old web. but the movement will never be easy, <br>and i also want to see peoples passions painted beautifully on their own digital canvas.</p>
