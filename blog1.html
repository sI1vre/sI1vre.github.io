    <h2>POST #1 - MAKING THE SITE</h2>
    <p>so, yeah, i guess i have a blog now...i think it'll be a good use of my time if i remember it.<br>
        i don't really have anything to talk about, so i'll run you through how i made the site.
    <br>this site is literally held together by spaghetti, so i'll keep this post to just text.
<br>
<br>
i decided to make this site when i was scrolling reddit (i should be using lemmy instead) when i saw <br>a post shilling neocities. and i was like, fuck it, why not?
<br>honestly, i've never been a fan of the web 1.0 designs this site is a fan of. i'm too young to remember <br>web 1.0, so i get the vibe, but it just doesnt look good.<br>
dont get me wrong, i get why people like it and i have found some sites i like, but...<br>i prefer the minimalist, space-relative style i've coded here.
<br>just looks better to me.
<br>
<br>
anyways, first step on making the site was making the homepage. and as somebody who uses vsc...<br>the built in neocities code editor is bad.
<br>i beg of you, *use vsc*. its way better. it's going to be annoying setting this site up so it isnt just <br>local, but whatever.</p>
